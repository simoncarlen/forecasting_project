First of all, I would like to give a large amount of thanks to my supervisor Sindri Magnússon, as well as my co-supervisor Ali Beikmohammadi, for guiding me through this project. Your help has been indispensable. I would also like to thank the reviewer, Petter Karlström, for valuable feedback on the first thesis draft. Lastly, I would like to thank my fiancée Anna for all the support and love you continuously give. Without you, this thesis would not have been possible.
